Utilities

typo.php  - is a crude syntax checker to avoid checking in files with simple 
typos. It basically just loads each of our project files at once. Run from 
cmdline and see if any parsing errors are reported.

extract.php - extracts translatable strings from our project files. It 
currently doesn't pick up strings in other libraries we might be using such as 
tinymce, simplepie, and the HTML parsers.

In order for extract to do its job, every use of the t() translation function 
must be preceded by one space. The string also can not contain parentheses. If
parens are required in a string which requires translation, please use hex escapes.

strings.php - a recent run of the strings program. This provides output that
is suitable for direct inclusion in the program once the app has been 
initialised. 

There are also translatable strings in the various files in the view 
directory. By setting $lang = 'something' in .htconfig.php, the application 
will search for view/something/filename prior to the English version in 
view/filename when loading templates and view files. The translated string table
should be placed in view/$lang/strings.php for automatic inclusion.

You are not restricted to using known languages. You may also use this to
translate the software into "pirate", "surfer" or merely to replace certain
text which you don't care for.
