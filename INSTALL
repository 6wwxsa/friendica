Installation guide

The following notes apply to pre-alpha releases. Some manual installation is required at this time. 


1. Requirements
	- Apache with mod-rewrite enabled and "Options All" so you can use a local .htaccess file
	- PHP > 5.1. The later the better. You'll need 5.3 for full openssl encryption support
	- PHP command line access with register_argc_argv set to true in the php.ini file
	- Mysql 5.x

2. Edit htconfig.php and change system settings. Rename to .htconfig.php

3. Import database.sql into your database with mysql command line or via phpmyadmin

4. Import updates.sql to catch any late-breaking devel changes

5. Put this directory into the root of your web server document area.
	- To use a subdir of your main site, set the 
	config variable $a->path to the relative subdir
	For example to use http://example.com/test - 
	set $a->path to 'test'.

6. Navigate to your site with a web browser and register an account.
