Dear $username,

	I've got good news and bad news... first the good news. 
'$fn' at '$dfrn_url' has accepted your connection request at
'$sitename'. 

The bad news is that '$fn' did not make you a "full friend", 
but rather accepted you as a "fan". [Maybe you were expecting this, 
maybe not.]

What this means is that '$fn' can communicate with you at any 
time and comment on your activities, but your communications to 
'$fn' may be restricted. In particular, you do NOT have the 
ability to exchange private mail. You are only able to communicate 
with '$fn' via your own status updates.

In the future, '$fn' MAY decide to seek a full connection and make 
a reciprocal request. If you approve such a request, you will then be 
considered mutual friends with full communication ability.  

The network at $sitename allows many types of relationships - 
as opposed to older social networks where friendship is either 
"yes" or "no" - with nothing in between.

Sincerely,

	$sitename Administrator
