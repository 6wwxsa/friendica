You could use proc_open for this:

proc_close(proc_open ("./script.php &", array(), $foo));

The empty array for the output specs prevents opening any pipes to the new
process, so proc_open doesn't wait for the execution of script.php to
finish - the last parameter is just there because it has to be.
proc_close() closes the process immediately, so your PHP script doesn't
stop.
