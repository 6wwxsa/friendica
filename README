Mistpark Server
Distributed Social Network

IMPORTANT: Please see the file INSTALL for system requirements.

Mistpark is a social network without boundaries. Mistpark installations can 
all link together into a global social network which is free from central 
control. We are also developing connectors to seamlessly communicate with many 
other open social networks and providers - GNU-social, Diaspora, Status.net, 
and even the larger closed services such as Facebook and Twitter.

Over the coming months, the boundaries between these networks will start to 
become indistinguishable as they all become part of your social circle.

Your personal thoughts and conversations belong to you - and are shared with 
those you wish to share them with. 

Period.  

Mistpark is secure, and as private as you wish it to be. Our privacy settings 
are straight-forward and simple, because we know that relationships rarely are 
(straight-forward and simple). Whether you're communicating with drinking 
buddies or potential employers, you can rest assured that each is only able to 
see the side of you that you wish to present. 

A single instance of Mistpark Server supports up to several hundred people 
using commodity hosting hardware. Each of these people can connect with any 
other supported network anywhere in the world and share photos, links, 
status updates, whatever. 

But maybe you don't want to be connected to the world. That's OK too. Mistpark 
may also be closed off from the global community and used to support
social networking amongst corporate, educational, religious, and other private
communities. This makes it an excellent choice for the social networking needs
of young teenagers. Their network can grow to global scope as their maturity 
increases - and can be made available only to their known friends until then.

Every person on Mistpark has unlimited profiles available to them. There is a 
"public profile" which can be seen by anybody. Additional profiles may be 
tailored to specific groups or individuals.

Groups may be created and used for closed conversations. In this way your 
conversations with one group of friends is completely isolated from other 
friends or groups of friends.

At the present time, you may contact the author and raise issues via
the source code repository on github.com.

It's your network now. If social networking isn't what you thought it would 
be, help us to make it better.
