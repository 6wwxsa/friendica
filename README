Mistpark Server
Version 2.0 alpha

IMPORTANT: Please see the file INSTALL for system requirements.

Mistpark introduces a new generation of social networks. Mistpark Server
allows you to interact with other members of the Mistpark community using
the DFRN (Distributed Friends and Relations Network) protocol. Other networks
(such as Diaspora, OneSocialWeb, status.net, etc.) will be supported in the 
future as their products mature and protocol and privacy/rights issues are 
resolved between these networks. 

It's your network now. If social networking isn't what you thought it would 
be, help us to make it better.  

A single instance of Mistpark Server supports up to several hundred people 
using commodity hosting hardware. Also available from Mistpark Labs is 
Mistpark Personal Edition, which supports a single user. 

Please see http://dfrn.org for more information on the mistpark/DFRN project.

We will be providing a support site specifically for mistpark at 
http://mistpark.com at a future (unspecified) date. We are still 
evaluating wiki, forum, and bug-tracking software for use on the project. 
At the present time, you may contact the author and raise issues via
the source code repository on github. 

Please support mistpark with a donation.
