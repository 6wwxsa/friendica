    Friendika Communications Server

    http://project.friendika.com


	Friendika is a web application for managing social communications. Some
would call it a "social network" or "distributed social network". We think 
both terms have been over-used and don't really apply - though Friendika can
also fill those roles.

	At its essence, Friendika is a web application which can monitor various
information streams, and also let you participate in online conversations with
friends and associates using a variety of network protocols.

	Friendika also manages your personal profiles and photo albums and lets 
you tailor either of these to specific audiences. Your communications can be 
either open and public, or closed and private. You can easily create "groups"
of contacts with which you can partition your conversations into social
circles.

	Friendika is decentralised. Any account on any Friendika server can connect
with any other Friendika account on any other server. You can also connect to
friends on Status.Net and other federated social web services (e.g. identi.ca,
GNU-Social, etc.).

	Outgoing communications can be directed at these networks and/or your
existing accounts on Facebook and Twitter - and even delivered to email 
contacts.

	Incoming data streams aren't limited to traditional social networks.
They may include most any service that provide a syndication feed (both RSS
and Atom). This allows you to view communications from friends in other 
diverse social networks - such as Diaspora, Google Buzz, and millions of 
Wordpress blogs, news services, and other websites. Over time we will try to
build two-way bridges to many of these services so that you can freely
interact in both directions with anybody who allows it. 

	 Communications between supported networks are private and encrypted, 
using military grade encryption - and require mutual authentication of servers
before any data is exchanged. 

    Friendika has no boundaries and no central ownership. Anybody with a 
commodity PHP/MySQL web server can provide a membership hub, and each 
individual server can then support several thousand participating members 
- each with their own unique communication and privacy needs.

	If you are creating a website which requires social interaction, Friendika 
can take the place of blog software, forum software and feed readers, and
also provide individualised communications and content management - or
provide a ready alternative to traditional "monolithic" social networks.
